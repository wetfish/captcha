# Wetfish Captcha Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for the captcha project. The goal is to create a simple interactive game that is used to verify a human is using the website and prevent automated spam on the wiki and forums.

## Server-side

The server must generate randomized positions for fish and handle collision detection.


## Client-side

The client side would be a simple interface that displays fish and a net.
